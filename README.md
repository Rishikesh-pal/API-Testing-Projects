## Introduction

RestfulBooker.com is a fictitious hotel booking platform that provides a RESTful API for managing hotel bookings. This repository contains a set of API tests that ensure the correct implementation and behavior of the RestfulBooker API endpoints.

## Installation

1.  Clone this repository to your local machine.
2.  Install [INSERT DEPENDENCY MANAGER NAME] if necessary.
3.  Install the required dependencies by running [INSERT COMMAND FOR DEPENDENCY INSTALLATION], which will fetch the necessary testing framework and libraries.

## Usage

To execute the API tests, follow these steps:

1.  Open the terminal or command prompt.
2.  Navigate to the project directory.
3.  Run the command [INSERT COMMAND TO RUN THE TESTS]. This will trigger the execution of all the API test cases.
4.  Observe the test results in the terminal, which will provide information about the test cases, their execution status, and any failures or errors encountered.

## Test Cases

The API tests cover a variety of scenarios and endpoints provided by the RestfulBooker API. Some of the test cases included are:

-   **Authentication**: Tests to ensure the proper authentication and authorization mechanisms are in place.
-   **Booking Creation**: Tests to verify the creation of hotel bookings using the API.
-   **Booking Retrieval**: Tests to validate the retrieval of existing hotel bookings.
